            <p>
              I'm <strong>Tammana Kavyasri</strong>, a passionate and results-oriented <strong>Java Full Stack Developer</strong> with expertise in technologies like <strong>Java, Spring Boot, React.js, Node.js, MySQL</strong>, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ve successfully built and deployed several real-time applications, ranging from employee management systems to user authentication portals and business websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              I recently completed a full stack Java Developer at <strong>AZ SoftTech</strong>, where I developed and maintained Java-based applications with backend integrations. Currently, Iâ€™m working as a full stack intern at <strong>Credencer Technologies</strong>, contributing to both frontend and backend modules in live client projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in continuous learning, teamwork, and writing clean, scalable code. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, Iâ€™m always excited to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.
